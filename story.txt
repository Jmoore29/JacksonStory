There once was a man named Bob.
He was pretty good at his job.
All day long he chopped down trees.
Even in the winter when there were no leaves.

He would haul the logs off to a place downtown.
And repeat and repeat till all the trees were a ground.
Bob was a mad man, 7 foot tall.
If you ever needed help, to him you would call. 

Bob's only prob was related to the log.
He hit his head and got diagnosed with TBI.
It was tragic for his family.
