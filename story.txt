There once was a man named Bob.
He was pretty good at his job.
All day long he chopped down trees.
Even in the winter when there were no leaves. 
However there was always a breeze.

He would haul the logs off to a place downtown.
And repeat and repeat till all the trees were a ground.
Bob was a mad man, 7 foot tall.
If you ever needed help, to him you would call. 

Bob's only prob was related to the log.
He hit his head and got diagnosed with TBI.
It was tragic for his family.

His family fought over his estate.
They realized bob was poor.
They hate bob now.

Bob lived a good life, among thoose trees.
He was a simple man and care not for things like money.
The real joy of his life was when he found one of thoose special trees and could eat honey.
